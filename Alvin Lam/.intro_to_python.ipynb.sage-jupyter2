{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9eda67","input":"Finnally, functions can have a \"return\" statement. This is what the function sends back to the place it was called. You can think of functions like black boxes where the parameters in the parentheses are the input and the return statement is the output. This output can be saved to a variable to be used later.
